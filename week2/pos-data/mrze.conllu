The	_
Palestinian	_
militant	_
organisation	_
Hamas	_
has	_
announced	_
an	_
end	_
to	_
rocket	_
attacks	_
on	_
Israel	_
from	_
the	_
Gaza	_
Strip	_
after	_
a	_
weekend	_
of	_
escalating	_
violence	_
.	_
	_
Up	_
to	_
40	_
rockets	_
had	_
been	_
fired	_
at	_
Israel	_
,	_
weeks	_
after	_
its	_
military	_
withdrew	_
from	_
the	_
territory	_
.	_
	_
In	_
response	_
to	_
the	_
rockets	_
,	_
Israel	_
resumed	_
its	_
policy	_
of	_
targeting	_
militant	_
leaders	_
in	_
air	_
strikes	_
.	_
	_
Authorised	_
by	_
Ariel	_
Sharon	_
to	_
make	_
"	_
unrestricted	_
"	_
strikes	_
,	_
its	_
military	_
launched	_
new	_
missile	_
attacks	_
overnight	_
.	_
	_
It	_
looks	_
as	_
if	_
Hamas	_
has	_
thrown	_
in	_
the	_
towel	_
for	_
this	_
round	_
,	_
unable	_
to	_
take	_
the	_
beating	_
the	_
Israeli	_
Defense	_
Forces	_
have	_
unleashed	_
upon	_
this	_
terrorist	_
group	_
.	_
	_
Mahmoud	_
Zahar	_
,	_
Hamas's	_
leader	_
declared	_
the	_
cease	_
fire	_
after	_
Israel	_
killed	_
it's	_
former	_
leader	_
,	_
Muhammed	_
Sheikh	_
Khalil	_
.	_
	_
Hamas	_
has	_
become	_
rather	_
unpopular	_
in	_
Gaza	_
,	_
as	_
many	_
see	_
the	_
Israeli	_
air	_
strikes	_
as	_
a	_
response	_
towards	_
the	_
rocket	_
attacks	_
upon	_
Israeli	_
soil	_

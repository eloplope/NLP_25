was	_
thinking	_

	_
I	_
might	_
just	_
sell	_
the	_

You	_
have	_
always	_
been	_
on	_
the	_
move	_
seeking	_
affectionate	_
,	_
satisfying	_
and	_
harmonious	_
relationships	_
.	_
	_
Your	_
ultimate	_
goal	_
has	_
been	_
the	_
realisation	_
of	_
an	_
intimate	_
union	_
in	_
which	_
there	_
could	_
be	_
love	_
,	_
self	_
-	_
sacrifice	_
and	_
mutual	_
trust	_
.	_
	_
It	_
has	_
often	_
been	_
said	_
that	_
"	_
True	_
love	_
is	_
just	_
around	_
the	_
corner	_
"	_
...	_
and	_
maybe	_
...	_
if	_
you	_
haven't	_
found	_
it	_
as	_
yet	_
-	_
you	_
possibly	_
soon	_
will	_

	_
In	_
the	_
past	_
there	_
have	_
been	_
..	_
and	_
maybe	_
there	_
still	_
are	_
many	_
things	_
that	_
you	_
have	_
had	_
to	_
do	_
without	_
.	_
	_
You	_
have	_
now	_
decided	_
to	_
set	_
your	_
sights	_
on	_
a	_
position	_
or	_
situation	_
that	_
could	_
give	_
you	_
greater	_
prestige	_
and	_
which	_
will	_
afford	_
you	_
considerable	_
self	_
esteem	_
.	_
	_
You	_
wear	_
your	_
heart	_
on	_
your	_
sleeve	_
...	_
and	_
since	_
you	_
are	_
an	_
emotional	_
person	_
you	_
are	_
apt	_
to	_
give	_
your	_
all	_
...	_
heart	_
and	_
soul	_
...	_
to	_
all	_
those	_
that	_
show	_
you	_
a	_
little	_
affection	_
...	_
but	_
take	_
care	_
...	_
it	_
would	_
appear	_
that	_
you	_
have	_
been	_
extremely	_
hurt	_
in	_
the	_
past	_
...	_
and	_
you	_
keep	_
leaving	_
yourself	_
wide	_
open	_
for	_
punishment	_

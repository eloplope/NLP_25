There is a variety of conll formats, so it might be more correct to refer to them as conll-like formats.

An Eevee configuration file is available in the repo (`assignments/week2/eevee_pos.json`), and an explanation on how to use it is available from the [repo](https://github.com/AxelSorensenDev/Eevee). In short, you would have to import the configuration file with the ``Import task button``, and then import the POS data with the ``Import \"conll-like\" file`` button, then you can click ``Annotate`` and get started. The tool works completely in your browser, so make sure to download a backup of your data at a regular interval. Also, it has been made in collaboration with Rob, and any feedback is more than welcome. "

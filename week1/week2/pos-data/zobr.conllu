I	_
ran	_
across	_
this	_
item	_
on	_
the	_
Internet	_
.	_
	_
Sooooo	_
.	_
	_
The	_
United	_
States	_
goes	_
into	_
a	_
war	_
zone	_
and	_
evacuates	_
a	_
bunch	_
of	_
U.S.	_
citizens	_
(	_
most	_
of	_
whom	_
were	_
"	_
dual	_
-	_
citizens	_
"	_
)	_
.	_
	_
Then	_
,	_
eschewing	_
normal	_
procedure	_
,	_
the	_
Department	_
of	_
State	_
waived	_
the	_
fees	_
that	_
they	_
charge	_
for	_
evacuating	_
U.S.	_
citizen	_
.	_
	_
Why	_
?	_
	_
To	_
pander	_
to	_
the	_
mythical	_
"	_
Arab	_
street	_
"	_
,	_
of	_
course	_
.	_
	_
Now	_
,	_
I	_
would	_
argue	_
that	_
one	_
could	_
have	_
reasonably	_
predicted	_
that	_
some	_
form	_
of	_
military	_
violence	_
was	_
likely	_
to	_
occur	_
in	_
Lebanon	_
(	_
considering	_
that	_
the	_
country	_
has	_
been	_
experiencing	_
some	_
form	_
of	_
conflict	_
for	_
approximately	_
the	_
last	_
32	_
years	_
)	_
.	_
	_
In	_
other	_
words	_
,	_
those	_
Americans	_
were	_
there	_
by	_
their	_
own	_
choice	_
,	_
mired	_
in	_
a	_
situation	_
that	_
was	_
totally	_
predictable	_
.	_
	_
Yet	_
we	_
didn't	_
charge	_
them	_
for	_
the	_
evacuation	_
.	_
	_
This	_
is	_
unlike	_
the	_
situation	_
last	_
year	_
in	_
Asia	_
when	_
we	_
evacuated	_
U.S.	_
citizens	_
from	_
areas	_
that	_
were	_
hit	_
by	_
the	_
tsunami	_
-	_
a	_
phenomenon	_
that	_
is	_
much	_
less	_
predictable	_
than	_
the	_
Hezbollah	_
-	_
provoked	_
destruction	_
that	_
rained	_
down	_
on	_
Lebanon	_
.	_
	_
And	_
what	_
do	_
we	_
get	_
for	_
this	_
effort	_
?	_
	_
A	_
lawsuit	_
.	_
	_
That's	_
right	_
,	_
folks	_
.	_
	_
The	_
American	_
-	_
Arab	_
Discrimination	_
Committee	_
is	_
suing	_
Condoleeza	_
Rice	_
and	_
Donald	_
Rumsfeld	_
,	_
charging	_
that	_
they	_
mismanaged	_
the	_
evacuation	_
efforts	_
.	_
	_
Here's	_
an	_
excerpt	_
from	_
the	_
article	_
:	_
	_
Nina	_
Chahine	_

who	_
with	_
her	_
family	_
was	_
among	_
the	_
named	_
plaintiffs	_
in	_
the	_
lawsuit	_
,	_
said	_
her	_
wedding	_
in	_
the	_

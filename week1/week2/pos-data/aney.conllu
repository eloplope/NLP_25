the	_
following	_
inconvenience	_

I	_
have	_
decided	_
to	_
move	_
this	_
group	_
to	_
Yahoo	_
,	_
so	_
that	_
we	_
can	_
post	_
files	_
and	_
photos	_
and	_
other	_
useful	_
things	_
.	_
	_
So	_
please	_
update	_
whatever	_
you	_
need	_
to	_
and	_
go	_
to	_
	_
Again	_
I	_
apologize	_

but	_

be	_
better	_
over	_
there	_

I	_
for	_
one	_
was	_
very	_
happy	_
to	_
hear	_
about	_
your	_
quitting	_
smoking	_
.	_
	_
I've	_
never	_
been	_
a	_
smoker	_
&	_
am	_
a	_
very	_
strong	_
anti-smoker	_
,	_
but	_
I'm	_
an	_
over-eater	_
&	_
so	_
I	_
know	_
how	_
hard	_
it	_
is	_
to	_
change	_
a	_
habit	_
.	_
	_
Good	_
luck	_
w/	_
it	_
&	_
will	_
pray	_
for	_
you	_
to	_
have	_
the	_
willpower	_
to	_
be	_
smoke	_
-	_
free	_

I	_
would	_
like	_
to	_
invite	_
you	_
to	_
come	_
to	_
a	_
site	_
where	_
you	_
can	_
hear	_
talking	_
parakeets	_
that	_
are	_
not	_
just	_
mimicking	_
,	_
but	_
actually	_
talking	_
in	_
sophisticated	_
conversational	_
language	_
.	_
	_
This	_
is	_
a	_
major	_
breakthrough	_
in	_
the	_
animal	_
intelligence	_
field	_
and	_
a	_
must	_
see	_
/	_
hear	_
for	_
every	_
animal	_
intelligence	_
enthusiast	_

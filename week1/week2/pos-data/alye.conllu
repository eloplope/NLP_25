Take	_
a	_
ferry	_
ride	_
!!!	_
	_
It's	_
an	_
amazing	_
experience	_
!	_
	_
Is	_
it	_
better	_
to	_
book	_
a	_
cruise	_
online	_
or	_
by	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
?	_
	_
First	_
time	_
to	_
go	_
on	_
A	_
cruise	_
any	_
and	_
all	_
info	_
is	_
appreciated	_
	_
Personally	_
,	_
I	_
don't	_
find	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
to	_
be	_
of	_
value	_
to	_
me	_
as	_
I	_
am	_
willing	_
to	_
put	_
in	_
the	_
time	_
doing	_
research	_
on	_
the	_
internet	_
.	_
	_
I	_
have	_
not	_
had	_
good	_
experience	_
with	_
travel	_
agents	_
.	_
	_
They	_
don't	_
seem	_
to	_
know	_
anything	_
but	_
the	_
hype	_
they	_
are	_
told	_
and	_
the	_
packages	_
they	_
have	_
available	_
to	_
them	_
.	_
	_
The	_
one	_
time	_
I	_
actually	_
booked	_
through	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
I	_
did	_
not	_
get	_
all	_
of	_
the	_
amenities	_
I	_
had	_
paid	_
for	_
.	_
	_
The	_
few	_
times	_
I	_
have	_
consulted	_
with	_
a	_
travel	_
agent	_
I	_
was	_
able	_
to	_
find	_
the	_
same	_
for	_
less	_
on	_
my	_
own	_
,	_
and	_
more	_
options	_
than	_
what	_
they	_
were	_
selling	_
.	_
	_
So	_
now	_
I	_
do	_
not	_
bother	_
with	_
them	_
at	_
all	_
.	_
	_
best	_
is	_
using	_
an	_
online	_
travel	_
agent	_

My	_
Hamster	_
escaped	_
....	_
NEED	_
HELP	_

!?	_

....	_
I	_
have	_
a	_
dog	_
and	_
my	_
mother	_
is	_
really	_
really	_
terrified	_
of	_
hamsters	_
.	_
	_
Well	_
last	_
night	_
while	_
I	_
was	_
sleeping	_
,	_
my	_
hamster	_
escaped	_

his	_
cage	_
.	_
	_
He	_
is	_
in	_
my	_
room	_
,	_
but	_
there	_
are	_
so	_
many	_
things	_
inside	_
there	_
,	_
I	_
dunno	_
what	_
to	_
do	_
.	_
	_
I	_
have	_
lots	_
of	_
containers	_
in	_
there	_
.	_
	_
Anybody	_
give	_
me	_
ideas	_
like	_
a	_
trap	_
or	_
something	_
?	_
	_
Find	_

dog	_

Train this tagger on the language identification data, and evaluate its performance. Note that during each training step, you now get the predictions and loss on a whole batch directly. Use the following hyperparameters: 5 epochs over the full training data, word embeddings dimension: 100, rnn dimension of 50, learning rate of 0.01 in an [Adam optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) and a [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html).\n",

It is also ok to use only 1,000 sentences for your final model (or use the HPC to train the full model).\n",

We can convert the predictions values from our model (32\\*159\\*18 for 1 batch) to a flatter representation (5088\\*18) by using: `.view(BATCH_SIZE * max_len, -1)`.
